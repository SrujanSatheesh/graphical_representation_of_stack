# Stacks
A stack is a data-structure with Last in,first out feature.

The project aims at graphically representing the stack and the operations associated with it:

1.Push()-pushes an element into the stack

2.Pop()-deletes/retrieves an element from the top of the stack.

The project is written in C++ along with the GLUT package by C++ which helps in making graphics.
